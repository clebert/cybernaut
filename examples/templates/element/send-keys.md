## Information

> Modifier keys ([Key.SHIFT][webdriver-key], [Key.CONTROL][webdriver-key], [Key.ALT][webdriver-key], [Key.META][webdriver-key]) are stateful; once a modifier is processed in the keysequence, that key state is toggled until one of the following occurs:
>
> * The modifier key is encountered again in the sequence. At this point the state of the key is toggled (along with the appropriate keyup/down events).
>
> * The [Key.NULL][webdriver-key] key is encountered in the sequence. When this key is encountered, all modifier keys current in the down state are released (with accompanying keyup events).
>
> * The end of the keysequence is encountered. When there are no more keys to type, all depressed modifier keys are released (with accompanying keyup events).
>
> â€” *[selenium-webdriver.WebElement][webdriver-webelement]*
