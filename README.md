> Reliable, zero configuration end-to-end testing in BDD-style.

[![Example][example-png]][example-png]

WYSIWYMâ€”the above **human-readable** test output corresponds to what is programmed:

```js
import {browser, defineElement, it, test} from 'cybernaut';

test('This is an end-to-end test example for Cybernaut', async t => {
  await t.perform(browser.loadPage('http://example.com/'), {retries: 0});

  await t.assert(browser.pageTitle, it.should.equal('Example Domain'));

  const moreInformationLink = defineElement('more-information-link', 'a');

  await t.perform(moreInformationLink.click());

  await t.assert(browser.pageTitle, it.should.contain('IANA'));
});
```

This [example][example] can be easily executed in a Docker container,

on Chrome:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/clebert/cybernaut.git && cd cybernaut && \
./scripts/docker/build-example.sh chrome && ./scripts/docker/run-example.sh chrome
```

on Firefox:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/clebert/cybernaut.git && cd cybernaut && \
./scripts/docker/build-example.sh firefox && ./scripts/docker/run-example.sh firefox
```

on iPhone 6 Plus (via Mobile Emulation):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/clebert/cybernaut.git && cd cybernaut && \
./scripts/docker/build-example.sh iphone && ./scripts/docker/run-example.sh iphone
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev cybernaut
```

*Note: It is recommended to run your end-to-end tests with Docker.
Otherwise, if the default configuration is used, a current version of Chrome must be installed.
Cybernaut is tested with Chrome and Firefox and **provides** the latest drivers for these two.*

## Introduction

Cybernaut is build on top of selenium-webdriver and lets you control a browser with just a few lines of code.
Your end-to-end test code will look simple, concise and easy to read and is automatically output line by line in a human-readable form.
It provides a [`Promise`][mdn-promise]-based API and allows the use of [`async`][mdn-async]/[`await`][mdn-await] to write code without nesting and with the possibility of using control-flow primitives such as `if...else`.

There are pre-built Docker containers to run your end-to-end tests effortlessly in any environment such as Travis CI.

The integrated test runner executes all steps of your end-to-end tests in an atomic way.
This means that if one part of a test step fails, the entire test step fails and can then be repeated.
By this mechanism, a high reliability and thus stability of your end-to-end tests can be ensured.
